                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 ½ months ago, Manchester United players collapsed to the ground of Polsat Plus Arena in Gdansk, Poland.
                        They had just lost the Europa League final to Villarrreal in a heartbreaking penalty shootout.
                        As the players collected their 2nd place medals, they knew that they needed a new addition to the team to be able to compete for trophies.
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fast forward back to right now, and the Red Devils have that new addition.
                        The player takes form in Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the greatest players to ever play soccer.
                        As the memory of heartbreak is still fresh in the Red Devils’ minds, they know that they have the talent and motivation to beat Villarreal this time.
                        As they walk out onto the pitch Wednesday night, Cristiano Ronaldo will try to lead a bitter Manchester United team to victory.
