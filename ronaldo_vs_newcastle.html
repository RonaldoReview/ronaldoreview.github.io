            Ronaldo's Return
            </h1>
                <p class="ronaldo-paragraph">
                    When Cristiano Ronaldo walked out onto the pitch at Old Trafford, there was a sense of excitement and anticipation. 
                    For more than 7 years, Manchester United had struggled to provide their fans with anything truly extraodinary. 
                    Ronaldo's return was certainly the breath of fresh air that the United faithful needed.
                    As the stadium buzzed with an energy that had not been seen for years, fans around the world knew that Ronaldo's opening goal was imminent.
                    Sure enough, Ronaldo was able to create the magic that was expected from him moments later.
                    He pounced on a loose ball in the 6-yard box and tapped the ball home to score his first goal for Manchester United in 13 years.
                    After the halftime break, Newcastle was able to find an equalizer and the mood at Old Trafford went from 100 to 0.
                    The hosts were dumbstruck as the Magpies celebrated their shocking goal.
                    When all hope was lost, Cristiano Ronaldo sprung into action.
                    He collected a through ball from Paul Pogba and raced down the left flank.
                    As he prepared his shot, the only obstacle in his way from glory, was the Newcastle goalkeeper.
                    Without any doubt, Ronaldo slotted the ball through his legs as the stadium exploded.
                    Ronaldo had once again saved his boyhood club, picking up just where he left off 13 years ago.
