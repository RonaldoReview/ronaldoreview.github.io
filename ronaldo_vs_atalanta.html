            Ronaldo's Rescue Act
            </h1>
                <p class="ronaldo-paragraph">
                    It was a chilly night in Bergamo, Italy when Manchester United stepped on the pitch. 
                    The players could feel the danger of the Atalanta side they were about to face, and that danger came in 12 minutes. 
                    Josef Ilicic struck early for the hosts as the Slovenian left the visitors flustered after a strong start. 
                    Half an hour later, the visitors equalized through their trusty striker, Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored his 4th goal in 4 matches in the Champions League this season. 
                    Ten minutes after halftime however, the hosts retook the lead through Duvan Zapata, who finished a nice counterattack to give the Italian side the lead. 
                    When all hope seemed to be lost for United, sure enough, Ronaldo scored in the dying seconds to gain them a crucial point in the Champions League. 
                    Mason Greenwood had flicked the ball into the air and Ronaldo struck a sweet finish into the bottom corner to earn a draw for the English side. 
                    Once again, the Portuguese great delivered when United needed him the most, further proving why he is the greatest to ever grace a field.
